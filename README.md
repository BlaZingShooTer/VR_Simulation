# ðŸŽ“ Educational VR Simulation using Unity & XR Interaction Toolkit

This project is a Virtual Reality (VR) educational simulation built using **Unity** and the **XR Interaction Toolkit**. It aims to provide an immersive learning experience for users through interactive VR environments.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Built using **Unity 2021+**
- âœ… Uses **XR Interaction Toolkit** for VR input and interactions
- âœ… Supports major VR headsets (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, etc.)
- âœ… Interactive educational content (labs, demonstrations, or guided learning)
- âœ… Modular scene structure for easy expansion
- âœ… Clean, modular codebase

## ðŸ§  Learning Objective

The goal of this simulation is to:
- Help users understand [Insert topic here: e.g., physics experiments, human anatomy, chemical reactions]
- Encourage hands-on learning in a safe, virtual environment
- Demonstrate how VR can enhance conceptual understanding
